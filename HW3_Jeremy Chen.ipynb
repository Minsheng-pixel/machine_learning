Many of the questions ask for specific things to be in your notebooks and many of your questions may be answered in the step-by-step instructions. You will need include _all_ parts of the questions in your answers to recieve full credit.\n",

    "\n",
    "A computational graph is a framework to represent complex mathematical expressions as a directed graph of function compositions, starting from the simplest, to the most complex. For instance, the expression $e = (a+b)\\times(b+1)$ can be represented as a computational graph, as shown in the figure below. Each node represents a variable, where the direction represents the flow of inputs to (intermediate) outputs. All incoming variables are collected to be operated on by a function. \n",

    "Computational graphs allow for a computational abstraction to compute _exact_ partial derivatives of complex expressions, as a realization of the chain rule from calculus. For instance, computing $\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial a}$ involves essentially reversing the arrows and transporting intermediate partial derivatives back to $a$. This method is termed _backpropagation_ (short: _backprop_), and is a key ingredient of modern neural network frameworks that implement gradient descent (including PyTorch). The first-three sections of [Calculus on Computational Graphs: Backpropagation](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) should allow reasonable understanding for the next questions."

Therefore, the neural network can be recursively defined as $f_\\mathbf{w}(h^{(L)})$. Why can very deep networks (i.e. large $L$) with sigmoid non-linearities be hard to learn via backpropagation?\n",

    "The maximum derivative of the sigmoid activation function is 0.25 and when the sigmoid activation function value is either too high or too low, the derivative of the sigmoid function is very close to 0. Considering a deep network, the derivative of the weight is a product of term, and this small gradient will stack up to a extremly small number. For example, if we have two layers, then the early layer would learn slower than the later hidden layer, and this is called the vansihing gradient.  \n"

They are able to decompose the image into distinct features and use those features to classify images. Once you have your code working try generating your plot with different input images and see what patterns you can pick up on. Note that not all examples will look great, since the images are very low resolution. And congratulations on building and training your first neural networks!\n",

You will need to normalize your tensors so that their entries are in $[0, 1]$ for the plots to be rendered correctly.\n",
